      I've got almost five years of experience with web development,
      three of that I've mainly worked with React and React Native,

      Elixir and Go on my own and would love to do some work in them sometime.

          I've written a simple CLI tool in Node.js to make creating mailings easier
          for myself. It was allowing to use templates stylesheets and
          was later inlining all the styles and adding some mailing hacks like uppercase
          Margin for Outlook.
